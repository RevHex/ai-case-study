## Business Activities

* To make the clandestine insight surrounding corporate investments, lobbyists, and even stock trades among congressional members, that have been shielded by hedge funds and brokerage firms alike more accessible and practical.

* The target audience is retail investors, both laymen and professional alike. 

* By making this "alternative" data more accessible and offering api subscriptions.

* Their expertise lies in employing data analytics and machine learning to scrutinize financial data, aiding their clients in making well-informed investment choices. They provide an array of products and services, encompassing data feeds, bespoke research reports, and investment software tools.

## Landscape

* Fintech

* In general fintech aims to disrupt and ultimately supplant conventional financial service providers by demonstrating greater agility, catering to an overlooked segment of the population, or delivering swifter and superior service.

* Currently, the three most highly valued fintech companies are Ant Group, Stripe, and Revolut.

## Results

* Bringing to light congressioanl investments, exposing trends of insider trading, government contract statements, and providing data sets and api that normally would not be available to the leyman. 

* Customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value, and monthly recurring revenue are some of the core metrics used to mesaure companies in fintech. How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* Based on the limited resources available for comparison with other competitors in fintech, it appears they rank somewhere in the middle. Keep in mind that they are a small business with only 15 employees.

## Recommendations

* If their aim was to attract a broader audience, I would recommend providing their back testing program for free or at an entry-level price, albeit with limited access.

* This avenue has the potential to assist individuals with minimal or no investment background in becoming more accustomed to the concept. Expanding the consumer base would directly influence profitability, along with other fundamental metrics in the fintech industry.

* There wouldn't be a necessity for new software or hardware as it would leverage existing resources under their ownership and control. My proposal would merely alter the utilization and accessibility of their current program.
